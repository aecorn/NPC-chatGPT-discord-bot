Description = "Zarthuga is a new world, it only has 2500 years of history after the humanoid races arrived, but a lot has been crammed into that time.\nZarthuga was the playground of the gods, many a weird sight and creature was created in this time, but the gods wanted to show off, to be admired. Year zero of Zarthuga's timeline marks the entrance of the first humanoid races into the material plane. The dwarves, halflings, gnomes among others. The elves, half-elves, humans and tieflings arrived later.\n"

Some of these can be powered by a sentient soul, lending a \"second life\", at the cost of great transformation of the physical body. Like the [[Bound]] and [[Oozecut]].\n"
"Technology and Society" = "The setting is mildly steampunk, there are firearms (though not very available), magically powered steam-trains, there are rumours of air-ships. The advance of technology has moved so fast, that only the most central places have these sorts of things available, and the difference between big cities and smaller settlements was exaggerated by the advent of the publicly available [[Teleportation Circle]]s, at the hands of the [[Guild of Transport]] and their monopoly on [[Aetherflux]]. The introduction of the portals has massively changed the world. Revolutionising communication, travel, tourism, trade etc. It has also led to even further \"stratification\" between big cities and smaller towns. Concentrating power and wealth, away from the places creating the raw resources.\n"
"Gods & Portfolios" = "![[Zarthuga/assets/images/librus_death.jpg]]\nThe gods play, show off, but they also die, disappear. When they turn absent their portfolios suffer. Like when Knowledge was sapped, Death died, Sol disappeared and Magic cracked. These Apocalypses are in the past, and the world has, and is living with the consequences.\nRead more in [[Gods' effects on their portfolios]].\nSee the timeline of the previous apocalypses in the [[World events]].\n"
"The consequences of the Death of Death" = "![[Zarthuga/assets/images/Deity_ymigard.jpg]]\nWhen [[Ymigard - God of Endings]] disappeared, it [[Trapped souls on the material plane]]. Souls stopped finding their way to an afterlife. They instead linger on the material plane after the death of the body. After this event, the Death of Death, undead started appearing in the world. Usually the undead are a product of some degrading soul, attaching itself to something resembling a real body. Undead can also be created intentionally by a necromancer using souls as components, some times creating much more powerful undead than happen by accident. \nAs you might expect, most cultures frown upon any practice that does not respect a creatures soul, as you would respect the creature in life. \nWhen souls degrade they \"shed\" [[Soul Tear]]s, purple crystals grow from the surroundings. [[Soul Jar]]s are hollowed out Soul Tears, with the capability of housing, trapping souls. Most spellcasters can [[Move soul]]s into Soul Jars. This is useful for transportation of the souls to more permanent solutions, like placement in a [[Soul Repository]].\nSouls of lesser \"value\", maybe antagonistic humanoid monsters, are less frowned upon not handeling with respect. Spellcasters cast [[Crystallize soul]] on souls that can be turned directly into Soul Tears.\nThe [[Tearjerkers]] are an organization that specializes in handeling loose souls, providing Soul Jars and Soul Repositories to the public, as well as safe transportation of souls over distances.\n"
"The Night Century" = "![[Zarthuga/assets/images/night_century.jpg]]\nThe sun in the sky, is literally the remaining eye of [[Sol - God of Hope]].\nWhen he blinks, a day passes. When he sleeps, it is winter.\nSol used to have two eyes, but he disappeared for a century. This Century was named [[World events#1061 - Sol goes missing & Night Century|the Night Century.]]\nWhen he returned he only had one eye left, and the [[World events#1155 - Appearance of the World Pillars|The world pillars had appeared.]]\nDuring the Night Century, most humanoids went underground to forage for food, and avoid the roaming souls and ghosts on the surface. Many a dungeon was populated and expanded during this time.\n"
"Unstable magic" = "![[Zarthuga/assets/images/Deity_wedn.webp]]\n[[Wedn - God of Magic]] is missing, and certain magic has become unstable. Casting any Conjuration spell could lead to dangerous results. And the casting of such spells is banned within most civilisation. See [[House Rules]] for specifics.\n"
"Invasion of Demons and Devils" = "![[Zarthuga/assets/images/mount_flesh.jpg]]\nThe region of [[Arkrak]], fell to a sudden invasion of Devils and Demons. The [[Chasm of Nill]] is a man made \"moat\", that is a great feat of Geomancy. It halted the progrss of the hellish forces. A [[Mountain of Flesh]] is rumored to be growing in the marshes now, a product of the forces meeting at a central point. The guards in [[Nill]] fight continuously to keep the rest of the continent safe.\n"
"[[World events#Wyrding of Northhelm|The Wyrding of Northhelm]]" = "![[Zarthuga/assets/images/disaster_northhelm.png]]\nMore recent is a magical accident on the isle of Northhelm, causing great destruction and the fleeing of its people to mainland Zarth.

Atmosphere = "With a predominant [[Trollkin]] population Prinberg is a town of hard working, honest people.\nThe city is a result of the nearby [[Silver Mines]], the houses are built from raw rocks and wood. The weather is cold but dry. \nSilver Ore is piling up in the streets. Wood is used for burning in the mines, cracking the stone. \nThe town smells like wood and sulfur burning, the citizens are not the cleanest, but they are more often covered in stone dust or ash, rather than brown dirt.\nThe miners are the biggest working force in town, and their culture values strength and perseverance, over creativity and cultural exploits. The young Trollkin are fast to welcome newcomers, but rumors travel fast, and the road from accepted to shunned may be short.  \n![[Prinberg_town_map.jpg]]\n"
History = "In early Zarthugan history the area was a part of the great elvish empire. The elves subdued the [[Trollkin]] who were local to the mountain range to the north of Prinberg. \n"
Founding = "Nearby [[Narbay]] was established by the elves in the early 1000-ands, but Prinberg was not established until 2051, meaning the town is only about 500 years old. Some of the roads in the area were already established, running from [[Narbay]] through [[Wotirm]] to [[Tharostad]]. When the silver in the [[Silver Mines]] were discovered, in about 2046 the [[Bank of Tharostad]] started the mining project.\nThe town started as some simple barracks in 2046, what is now the Bank headquarters, and the town, Inn etc. grew out from there. The Wooden barricade was established in 2511 after the [[World events#2509 - War of the Swarms]] made psychological impact on the Prinbergers.\nThe town started as a sort of \"colony\" of [[Tharostad]], but has grown its own identity and the populace is now weighing the pros and cons of this close relationship.\n"
"Previous conflicts" = "About 200 years ago, in 2423, there was a battle between the Guard and the Miners guild, just north-east of the town. The tensions had grown over some time, over wages and days off. And came to a tipping point. The Miners \"won\", but at a huge cost. The Miners did after some time, gain higher wages and [[Calendar#Wednday|Wedndays]] off. The Guard had up to that point contained many dwarves, but because of the rising racial tensions, the [[Tharostad]] overseeres, decided, probably wisely, to recruit more guards from the local populace, and employ less dwarves. There are still some resentment against dwarves in the city, which stems from this episode, but its not something people consider much of the time anymore.\nThe abandonment of Wotirm led to a migration of people. Many Wotirims wanted to move to Prinberg, but Prinberg could not sustain all of them. Some went to Narbay, some to other places. Only a few got jobs in Prinberg. This is 50 years ago, but still a sore point for the elder generations. With hindsight, many think that more should have been able to stay.\n"
"The railroad" = "[[Tharostad]] established an \"internal\" railroad system early on, to move heavy ore and metals around town and to local resources. Prinberg was established before the technology for the Teleportation circles were discovered, and soon a railworks project started, to simplify moving silver ore from Prinberg to [[Tharostad]]. For many years this railroad ran all the ore to Tharostad, even after the town got a Transportation circle. But after the railroad fell to ill-repare, the [[Bank of Tharostad]] decided that running tracks down to town and carrying the ore, manually through the portal would be more cost-effective than fixing up the railroad. \nBut due to a recent power struggle, some work has been done to restore the road and railroad from Prinberg towards [[Tharostad]].\n"

"Current ruler" = "[[Rognar - Overseer from Thurostad]] currently acts as the governing body of Prinberg. He answers directly to [[Bank of Tharostad]], but has so far balanced the needs of the people of Prinberg against the wishes of the bank. Some Prinbergers might be suspicious of his split allegiances, but so far they have no real reason to complain. Except, for the degrading public Transport Circle, whose degradation is a result of a power struggle between the [[Guild of Transport]] and the [[Bank of Tharostad]].\n"
"Other notable people" = "- [[Captain - Busgar Elthorp]]\n- [[Shopkeep - Aina]]\n- [[Innkeeper - Friggar]]\n- [[Priestsmith - Kaldir]]\n- [[Miners Guild - Grosjar]]\n- [[Wannabe postman - Baldasj]]\n"
Tourism = "People used to come to see the mines (to the miners dismay), and to buy silver wares from \"their origin\". Usually this was combined with trips to Tharostad, with Prinberg being the stop for more \"natural\" views. Maybe not being something the tourists said out loud, but Prinberg has the highest density of [[Trollkin]] in the world, and some tourists might have come just to see the \"culture of the Trollkin\" for themselves. In addition the view of [[Everstorm peak]] or the [[Emberwood]] might have been draws for more adventurous tourists.    \n"
"Traditions, customs and holidays" = "Payday for the miners comes once a month on the 1st, and is a \"holiday\" of sorts, with the town reading for it, and relaxing after. \nThe Miners have [[Calendar#Wednday|Wedndays]] of, making the town more busy, and the door at the Inn needs to be oiled after.\n"
"Teleport circles" = "Prinbergs single public teleport circle goes to [[Tharostad]], to its sister-circle, which runs back to Prinberg.\nHowever, the circle has been degrading heavily and needs a renewal of [[Aetherflux]], it has come to such a severity that most Prinbergers will not dare travelling with it.\n"
"Handling of souls" = "Prinberg has no [[Soul Repository]] of its own. [[Soul Jar]]s have been regularly sent with [[The Mail]] to the repository in [[Tharostad]]. The use of [[Crystallize soul]] is less frowned upon in smaller towns than in bigger cities. Because of the degrading Teleportation Circle there were some Soul Jars being held at the post office. One of the reasons [[Tarr - postman]] made his final journey. Having them stored for longer times than necessary in the Mail room might be dangerous.\n"
"General Store" = "[[Shopkeep - Aina]] runs the general store. She has most common items, in addition to a large selection of silver wares mostly made by [[Priestsmith - Kaldir]]s workshop. She has some healing potions, and maybe one or two magic items, but it is not the place for the most expensive wares. She does not sell food or rations, go to the Inn or the Farmers market for spoilable goods.\nMost of her items she has carried herself through the portal, but she has not dared going through it for about a month or two. This has impacted her selection, economy and is worrying here somewhat.\n"
"Inn - \"The Nugget\"" = "[[Innkeeper - Friggar]] runs the local inn, with the help of [[Bar maid - Rinjah]]. The Inn is named \"The Silver Nugget\", but most just call it \"The Nugget\". Friggar lives on the upper floor, where there also are some rooms for rent. Rinjah lives in a house with her parents, on the outskirts. The inn serves alcohol and food. They also prepare rations for travelling parties on demand. Their food is usally some sort of stew, bread, beer and wine. [[Trollkin]] have a tradition for home-made stronger stuff. But [[Captain - Busgar Elthorp]] has requested that [[Innkeeper - Friggar]] stops selling the stronger stuff, cause keeping the order on the Miners' payday has been quite tough. Keeping the selection to beer on those days has helped a lot. Some see this as an infringement against [[Trollkin]] culture though.\n"
"Miners guild meeting room" = "The [[Guild of Miners]] rents a portion of the inns basement as their base of operations. Regular meetings here are held to advocate for the rights and pay of the miners, and send signals to [[Rognar - Overseer from Thurostad]] about \"what the town wants\". [[Miners Guild - Grosjar]] is often found here, even when there is not a meeting being held.\n"
Smith = "[[Priestsmith - Kaldir]] represents [[Midgond - God of Craft]] and the [[Guild of Craft]] in Prinberg. He has a couple of followers who all work and preach in his workshop. They repair and craft tools for the [[Guild of Miners]] and the town, on their \"down-time\" they create beautiful wares from the abundant silver ore in town. Though the ore extraction techniques employed in [[Tharostad]] are much more efficient than what they can manage in Prinberg alone.\n"
"Geography & Climate" = "Cold and dry, Prinberg is located inland behind a mountain range to the north. The rain that comes is mostly with winds from the west and south. When the wind comes from the north and east, which is more usual, the air stays dry. Cold air runs down from the mountains, and the winters can be especially harsh, with little snow, but very low temperatures.\n![[Prinberg Area]]\n"
"Defences & Military" = "A wooden barricade runs around the town. There are regular attacks from beasts, or the results from degraded souls. But rarely from sentient beings. The barricade is guarded at all times. Most travellers are accompanied by members of the Guard. But not when moving within half a day's distance from the town. This freedom of movement is at the Prinbergers own risk. The wilds push back against the city's presence... \nThe barricade allows the guards to have relative good control over who arrives and leaves on foot. But sneaking out and in is absolutely possible for those who know the city. \n"
"Natural Resources" = "The main resource of Prinberg is Silver Ore from the [[Silver Mines]]. The main buyer of the Ore is the [[Bank of Tharostad]], which has resulted in a close relationship, as the Prinberg Teleportation Circle goes directly to [[Tharostad]], and was primarily used to transport Silver ore to Tharostad, and other resources back to Prinberg.
